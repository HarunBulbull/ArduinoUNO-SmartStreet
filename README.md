Our smart street lights, designed as part of our smart street project, store energy from the sun during the day for use at night. The LDR sensor on top of the lamp turns on the lights when it detects that it is dark. The PIR sensor, on the other hand, keeps the lights on at 20% brightness when there is no one on the street to make people feel safe, and turns on the lights at maximum brightness when someone is present. This saves energy.

Requirements:
Arduino Uno
PIR Sensor
LDR Sensor
Light Source
Battery
Charging Module
Fan (Optional)
On-Off Switch (Optional)
